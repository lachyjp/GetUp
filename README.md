# GetUp â†‘

Project hosted at https://lachyjp.github.io/GetUp/

Up Bank is an Australian neobank owned by Bendigo/Adelaide bank that is currently mobile-app exclusive and does not have a web/desktop solution for users, this project aims to fill that gap.

This is a simple javascript-based project allowing members of Up Bank to view their current account balances and latest transactions on a locally run webpage or at https://lachyjp.github.io/GetUp/
